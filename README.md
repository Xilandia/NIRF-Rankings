To use:

First, create a new instance of Apache Cassandra on Docker Desktop locally, making sure to expose port 9042:9042.
Second, run through the Database Initialization notebook in order to prepare the database to import data.
Third, run through the first half of the Dataset Import and Processing notebook to fill up the tables with data.

The latter half of the Dataset Import and Processing notebook includes some sample visualizations for the data.
